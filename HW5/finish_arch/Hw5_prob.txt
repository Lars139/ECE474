HW5: Basic concept

Goal: We want to design a RECEIVER for a satellite communication. (Assuming no packet loss via communication channel)

Background: 
We have satellite orbiting a planet with a built in transceiver.  
The satellite orbits around the planet reading 4 different temperature values (4 distinct bytes)
and sends the temperature value to the receiver via serial communication.

The serial communication uses a basic format at 50MHz:
{HEARDER || TEMP1 || TEMP2 || TEMP3 || TEMP4 || Header_of_the_next_packet .....}
	HEADER - The header of the packet: 
		If the header has the value of 0xA5 or 0xC3, the follow next 4 bytes are the temperature values
		If the header has the value of 0x57 or 0xC5, ignore the rest of the packet until it sees the next header
	
	TEMPx - the recorded temperature values which can have the value range from [0,127]
	
Note: The serial communication allows fragmented packet communication. 
Meaning:
 {HEADER || TEMP1 || .... wait .... || TEMP2 || TEMP3 || TEMP4 || ....}
 OR
 {HEADER || ... wait ... || TEMP1 || TEMP2 || TEMP3 || TEMP4 || ...}
are valid communication.  (Given there is no packet loss) 

Homework Problem:
	Design a receiver for the satellite communication which will find the average value of the temperature and store the avg value in RAM. 

Remark: RAM operates on 2MHz clock signal.
